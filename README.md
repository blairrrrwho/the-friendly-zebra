# The Friendly Zebra Password Generator

## Description

This webpage is a JavaScript-based random password generator; the complexity of the password is determined by the user's input. The generator is based on alerts, prompts, and confirms, which all require some type of response or click in order to move forward. The user gets to choose the length of the password and what kind of characters the password needs to be. The parameters are as follows: character length has to be between 8 and 128. The user then will have four options of character types to choose from - the user can select however many types desired, with the minimum being one.
